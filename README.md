## :dart: Description & objective

Solidatech is a French tech4good NGO that sells software and hardware solutions to other French NGOs at a fair price. Given the multitude of products and tutorials available on Solidatech’s website, it is easy for new associations to get lost on the platform if they do not know precisely what they need to expand. In 2020, three CentraleSupélec students and I thus went on to build a resource recommender system for Solidatech based on a web questionnaire, so that new customers could easily identify their needs and find ways to fill in their gaps.
